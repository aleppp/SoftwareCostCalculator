# SoftwareCostCalculator
This project incorporates CSC577 - Software Engineering Theories and Principles

C3 is a software developed to help software developers to calculate and determine the cost of their projects. The program aims to help developers to decide the cost that needed to be charged to their clients, how many members required to deliver the system, and how many months required to complete it. 

This system also can calculate how many members that you actually need to deliver the system efficiently. This can prevent developers from being over-worked and can lead to delivering a poor system that need to be fixed.

The system use COCOMO model calculation approach. The system offers up to 9 languages which is Access, Basic, C, C++, COBOL, Delphi, Java, ML, Visual Basic 5. Each language has different kilo lines of codes.
